Eien is Leaf's implementation of a high-speed, high-performance server based on powerful tools like [Open Swoole](https://swoole.co.uk/) and [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src). Eien loads your app in memory and shares a state between requests to achieve amazing speeds.

When serving Leaf apps with Eien, you gain additional performance improvements due to Leaf's lightweight and super fast nature.

> Note that Eien runs on Swoole, so you need to have the swoole extension installed.
> - [Swoole Installation docs](https://openswoole.com/docs/get-started/installation)
> - [In case you have errors installing swoole on Mac](https://parsinta.com/articles/setup-php-swoole-in-your-mac-os)

## Installation

You can easily install Eien using the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev):

```sh
leaf install eien
```

Or with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/eien
```

## Basic Usage

Just like with the rest of Leaf, Eien is built to work out of the box without configuring anything or writing any extra code. Once Leaf detects Eien, it will automatically set everything up for you.
